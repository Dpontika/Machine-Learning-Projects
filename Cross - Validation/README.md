# **Cross-Validation with Iris Dataset**

# **Overview**



This project introduces fundamental machine learning concepts including data loading, preprocessing, and cross-validation using the famous Iris flower dataset. 

The program loads the Iris dataset, preprocesses the data by converting class labels to numerical values, and performs 9-fold cross-validation. For each fold, 

it visualizes the training and testing data splits using plots.
